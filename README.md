# Free Time / Vacation Planner — MLB, NFL, Stanford, Cal, Westwood One radio

A year-round answer to one question: **when is there nothing on the radio worth staying home for?**
Coverage runs from 2026-11-02 to 2030-02-28, computed in Pacific time for San Francisco 94122.

**Live site:** https://karagemop466-tech.github.io/Korea5/

## Headline finding

No 7-day window in 2027, 2028 or 2029 is completely free of MLB, NFL, Stanford/Cal football and Westwood One national radio.
The longest run with nothing on air is six days, and it recurs in January–February between NFL playoff weekends.

See [`research/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`](research/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md) for the full write-up.

## What is in here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `*.html` | The published site (static, no build step at deploy time) |
| `assets/` | Stylesheet and the calendar JavaScript |
| `data/mlb-2026.json`, `data/mlb-2027.json` | Official MLB schedules pulled from the MLB StatsAPI |
| `data/curated/` | Hand-checked NFL, Westwood One and NCAAF rows, each with `verifyTokens` and a source URL |
| `data/events-<year>.json` | Normalized event feed the site reads (verified + estimated layers) |
| `data/derived/analysis.json` | Per-day free/busy windows, free streaks and ranked vacation windows |
| `verification/` | Machine-readable verification report and link check |
| `research/` | Executive summary, probe results, and text snapshots of official pages |
| `scripts/` | Fetch, build, analyze, verify, site and docs generators |

## Rebuild

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_mlb.py      # official MLB feed (2026-2029; 2028/29 return nothing, by design)
python3 scripts/build_events.py   # normalize + add the labelled estimate layer
python3 scripts/analyze.py        # free/busy windows, free streaks, vacation ranking
python3 scripts/build_site.py     # regenerate the HTML
python3 scripts/check_links.py    # fail if any local link is broken
python3 scripts/verify.py         # re-check every curated row against its official page (needs network)
```

Data acquisition and verification run in GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`), because the schedule sources are only
reachable from a normal network. Everything the site needs is committed, so Pages can serve it statically.

## Honesty rules used throughout

* Every table row links to an official source.
* Where an official source has not published a value, the cell is blank and the row is listed on the Flagged page.
* Estimated rows are labelled and never invent matchups.
